Simple, JDK only implementation of MapReduce concept. For simplicity, uses in-memory storage instead of distributed file system and job queue/threads to simulate multiple workers.

Run exemples by invoking main methods in classes:
- ps.mapreduce.impl.example.DistributedGrep
- ps.mapreduce.impl.example.WordCount
